<h1><strong> Original poems written by John Cooper-Clarke</h1></strong>
<br>
<p><i>A selection of ten poems by John Cooper Clarke. In the following pages,
these shall be explored through the theme of discussion, taking place between
these poems' speaker and their reader. In this page the poems are displayed
whole, with all the different elements of interest, as well as all the other
words that give them meaning, mixed up together. Aside from this page, however,
each page will highlight different themes in the poems, by displaying the
words associated with each theme while leaving out the rest of the text.</p></i>

Note: original HTML generated included many more divs that determined the
text to appear in the centre. However, by adding CSS, I was able to remove the
excess divs and excess CSS-instructions in the text, in order to have cleaner
HTML files overall.

<h2>1. Pagan</h2>
<h3>By John Cooper Clarke </h3>
  <p>Roses are reddish<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Violets are blueish<br>If it weren’t for Christmas<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;We’d all be Jewish<br></p>
  <p>Get born again<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Ronald Reagan?<br>No thanks<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I’d rather be a pagan<br></p><br><br>

<h2>2. Action Man</h2>
<h3>By John Cooper Clarke </h3>
  <p>Give him scars and khaki to wear<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove his balls, he’ll go anywhere<br>He doesn’t speak, he doesn’t dare<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Death sneaks, he isn’t scared<br>Minus balls, he doesn’t care<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacks beware, action man.<br>He can ack-ack Ackrington, bomb Berlin<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce your car to a heap of tin<br>Wage war, what’s more – win<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Punctured skin means nothing to him<br>The human grenade minus pin<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s him, action man<br></p>
  <p>A chin with a thin Kirk Douglas cleft<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Squad by the bleeding left<br>Don’t shout he’s deaf<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Head over heels in love with death<br>Beware of the wrath of the man bereft<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;No marriage plans for action man<br></p><br><br>

<h2>3. Arts N' Crafts</h2>
<h3>By John Cooper Clarke </h3>
  <p>Out of bed into the Shed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;To paint the wooden roses red<br>To ride a rocking quadruped<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;With a big idea in your head<br></p>
  <p>Form and function in a line<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The rudiments of good design<br>From the oaken leg to the fine wine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;To table tops of melamine<br></p>
  <p>There’s nothing that you couldn’t make<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;No effect you  couldn’t fake<br>A pebble sprayed with metal flake<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would make a precious paperweight<br></p>
  <p>Teddy bears to stuff with stuff<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like nylon mink from a lady’s muff<br>Cotton balls and a powder puff<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pom poms and pocket fluff<br></p>
  <p>Stainless steel and a rock hard aura<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The marble glance of a lost explorer<br>A heavy heart for the love of Nora<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chains of flowers on a draped  amphora <br></p>
  <p>Time time time to slay<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each crowded hour of every day<br>Where indolence is kept at bay<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;In an arty-crafy kinda way<br></p><br><br>

<h2>4. Bunch of Twigs</h2>
<h3>By John Cooper Clarke</h3>
  <p>In the isle of man there are no louts<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;They’re all down the dungeons dishing it out<br>Think them tough but tender<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bunch of twigs<br>And a young offender<br></p>
  <p>Old men with purple necks<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who tell you sport is better than sex<br>Rejuvenare an old pudenda<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bunch of twigs and a young offender<br></p>
  <p>Sweet little fifteen on a summer hike<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vandal maimed, vandal spite<br>Vandals sent to up above<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A punishment meted out with love<br></p><br><br>

<h2>5. Euro Communist/Gucci Socialist</h2>
<h3>By John Cooper Clarke</h3>
  <p>For a modern home and cheap electricity<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Streamlined functional neat simplicity<br> Put yourself on the slum clearance list<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dial a dialectical materialist<br>Find out what your net potential is<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Get married to an existentialist<br>Don’t doubt your own identity<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dress down to a cool anonymity<br>The Pierre Cardinline to infinity<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothes to climb the meritocracy<br>The new age of benevolent bureaucracy<br></p>
  <p>I like to visit all the big cities<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Museums and municipal facilities<br>I strive for critical ability<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I thrive on political activity<br>I’m alive in a new society<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I arrive quickly quietly<br>The car that I drive is the family variety<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Roman Catholic Marxist Leninist<br>Happily married to an eloquent feminist<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A lapsed atheist all my memories<br>Measure the multitude’s deafening density<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Psycho citizens are my enemies<br>Crypto nazis and their remedies<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep the city silent as the cemetery’s<br>Architechtural gothic immensity<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A new name on the less-than-kosher list<br>The euro-communist / a gucci socialist<br></p><br><br>

<h2>6. Full-Time Loser</h2>
<h3>By John Cooper Clarke</h3>
  <p>Stop that horse<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears my shirt<br>Regret remorse<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;O how they hurt<br>I knock on doors<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;They turn to dirt<br>Always the beggar<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Never the chooser<br>Half-clever<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time loser<br></p>
  <p>From the slumberland<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That time forgot<br>To the wonderland<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a spineless clot<br>Who understands<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who calls the shots<br>You might know<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another user<br>Part-time poet<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time loser<br></p><br><br>

<h2>7. Give Me What I Need</h2>
<h3>By John Cooper Clarke</h3>
  <p>Poetry and laughter, how frivolous the sound<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where imminent disaster and misery abound<br>Les Fleurs du Malcontent lie strangled in the weed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may never know what I want, but I know what I need.<br></p>
  <p>A victim by profession; blame it on the girl<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;With the vacant possession of the sedentary world<br>I believe in miracles, it’s written in the creed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Immaculate connection.<br>Give me what I need.<br></p><br><br>

<h2>8. Are You The Business</h2>
<h3>By John Cooper Clarke</h3>
  <p>Does Superman wear blue tights<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep away from kryptonite<br>Do old ladies get mugged at night<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you the business<br></p>
  <p>Do workers want a living wage<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do rock stars lie about their age<br>Would a tiger run from an open cage<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you the business<br></p>
  <p>Are you the fuck off business<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is my first name John<br>Is strangeways full of prisoners<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I over twenty-one<br></p>
  <p>Are the royal family really rich<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Scooby-Doo one son-of-a bitch<br>Is Wembley stadium a football pitch<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you the business<br></p>

  <p>Does Oliver Reed ever get pissed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Chubby Checker do the twist<br>Was Karl Marx a communist<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you the business<br></p>
  <p>Was James Deana cool cat<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Kennedy a democrat<br>Do Hacedic men wear hats<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you the business<br></p>
  <p>Will narcotics get you hooked<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Did Dostoyevsky write the odd book<br>Was Al Capone a bit of a crook<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you the business<br></p>
  <p>Did Buddy Holly wear horn-rimmed specs<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is czechoslovakia full of czechs<br>Did Sigmund Freud consider sex<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you the business<br></p>

<h2>9. Network South East</h2>
<h3>By John Cooper Clarke</h3>
<p>It’s so insubstantial, it swerves on the curves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise of the upholstery batters the nerves. <br>If you were a passenger day after day<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;You’d pay to have somebody blow you away.<br>As I travel these tracks I cannot forgive<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;How I lose by degrees the incentive to live<br>Knowing that vengeance will never be mine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s what hurts on the misery line.<br>Hell on Wheels with go-faster stripes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;These passengers here are the tolerant type<br>I’d like to see them in seven months’ time<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the shatter-proof windows are splattered with slime<br>And they’ve sacked all the fellas who did the repairs<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And shovelled the cheeseburgers off the chairs<br>From germ-free services smelling of pine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it’s travel no-class on the misery line.<br></p><br><br><div align="center">

<h2>10. I Wanna Be Yours</h2>
<h3>By John Cooper Clarke</h3>
  <p>I wanna be your vacuum cleaner<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing in your dust<br>I wanna be your Ford Cortina<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will never rust<br>If you like your coffee hot<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be your coffee pot<br>You call the shots<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna be yours<br></p>
  <p>I wanna be your raincoat<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;For those frequent rainy days<br>I wanna be your dreamboat<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to sail away<br>Let me be your teddy bear<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Take me with you anywhere<br>I don’t care<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna be yours<br></p>
  <p>I wanna be your electric meter<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not run out<br>I wanna be the electric heater<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ll get cold without<br>I wanna be your setting lotion<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold your hair in deep devotion<br>Deep as the deep Atlantic ocean<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s how deep is my devotion<br></p><br><br></body>
