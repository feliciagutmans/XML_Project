        <!--Poet giving readers a series of instructions. Note constrast between the imperative in this stanza
        and the use of "I" in the next stanza. As in many poems, creating a sense of clear opposition between
        "I" and "you", between the speaker and the reader in these poems. Not necessarily aggressive, but 
        emphasising the theme of a two-way conversation between these poems.-->
