In encoding this text I chose to include some of the most basic structural elements of its genre,
poetry, by outlining the stanzas and line strucutre of the text, as well as denoting the author and 
title of the peom in the beginning of the encoding. 

However, the main work here went into analysing 
the conversational elements in the poems, where Cooper-Clarke seems to be having a chat directly 
with the reader. The main tools that I identified that enabled CC to do this comes from 
1.Making references to things that his readers would be familiar with 
2. Addressing the reader directly, as if speaking to them in person, whether You, I or We. 
Also use of imperative, as if to give advice  or order, as if he is a friend speaking directly 
to the reader.
3. Using colloquial language, including things like swear words and spoken language to make the peoms seem spoken 
4. Making references to people that would be known to his readers, from politicans to 
fictional characters, such that the poems almost seem like gossip in themselves, and to draw the 
viewer in through a sense of common understanding/shared culture. 

At least one of all these four elements are included in every one of his poems, the ones here being
selected randomly based on my own taste, usually more. This establishes CC's pseudo-chat with his 
readers to be a poetic tool that he employs universally.

The form and content elements of this analysis will be kept separate- notably, I will not make any 
comment on the content of the title as this is considered to be a strucutural element so will not
have any bearing on our anaysis of the content of the poem.

the tools of referring to something else, directly addressing the reader & the
