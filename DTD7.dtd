In encoding this text I chose to include some of the most basic structural elements of its genre,
poetry, by outlining the stanzas and line strucutre of the text, as well as denoting the author and 
title of the peom in the beginning of the encoding. 

However, the main work here went into analysing 
the conversational elements in the poems, where Cooper-Clarke seems to be having a chat directly 
with the reader. The main tools that I identified that enabled CC to do this comes from 
1.Making references to things that his readers would be familiar with 
2. Addressing the reader directly, as if speaking to them in person, whether You, I or We. 
Also use of imperative, as if to give advice  or order, as if he is a friend speaking directly 
to the reader.
3. Using colloquial language, including things like swear words and spoken language to make the peoms seem spoken 
4. Making references to people that would be known to his readers, from politicans to 
fictional characters, such that the poems almost seem like gossip in themselves, and to draw the 
viewer in through a sense of common understanding/shared culture. 

At least one of all these four elements are included in every one of his poems, the ones here being
selected randomly based on my own taste, usually more. This establishes CC's pseudo-chat with his 
readers to be a poetic tool that he employs universally.

The form and content elements of this analysis will be kept separate- notably, I will not make any 
comment on the content of the title as this is considered to be a strucutural element so will not
have any bearing on our anaysis of the content of the poem.

In encoding this text I chose to include some of the most basic structural elements of its genre,
poetry, by outlining the stanzas and line strucutre of the text, as well as denoting the author and 
title of the peom in the beginning of the encoding. I chose to annotate the numbers of each of the 
stanzas and lines in these texts for several reasons. Firstly, when discussing the poems, saying the 
stanza and line numbers is always key to describing the text and what's going on inside of it. It is also
a handy tool for this particular report, so that I can refer to specific lines in the poems with ease, without
either my markers or myself having to count lines or search for what I am referring to. This strucutral element
aslo allows for some interesting observations in terms of eg. how many lines are included in each stanza. Finally,
the consistency in attotating the lines, though it may seem repetitive, added a sense of continuity between the
poems that ties them together as one genre, one body of work under the author's name. Laying out
the title and author's name also creates this effect and the fact that these parts of the XML
document are not annotated solidifies these as a strucural element in the analysis, separating their
function from that of the rest of the text in the poem. 

However, the main work here went into analysing 
the conversational elements in the poems, where Cooper-Clarke seems to be having a chat directly 
with the reader. The main tools that I identified that enabled CC to do this comes from 
1.Making references to things that his readers would be familiar with 
2. Addressing the reader directly, as if speaking to them in person, whether You, I or We. 
Also use of imperative, as if to give advice  or order, as if he is a friend speaking directly 
to the reader.
3. Using colloquial language, including things like swear words and spoken language to make the peoms seem spoken 
4. Making references to people that would be known to his readers, from politicans to 
fictional characters, such that the poems almost seem like gossip in themselves, and to draw the

The form and content elements of this analysis will be kept separate- notably, I will not make any 
comment on the content of the title as this is considered to be a strucutural element so will not
have any bearing on our anaysis of the content of the poem.

Note- it's often quite hard to determine which words are neutral words or which have political connotations. Eg. does
"war" count as a politial reference, same as the word "Nazi"? In this way, most words could be argued to be referentially
loaded. However, whereas there are some words that may easily be argued to have some kind of connotation, other words
are indistinguishable from the concepts that they connote. For instance, while "cities" connotes a sense of place- as 
opposed to directly naming a particular place, "Marxist" is undeniably tied to politics. Therefore, to make this analysis
as consistent as possible, I have endeavoured to only annotate those words with unambigous links to other concepts. Thus
"citizens" might have political inclinations, these will not be annotated, allowing for undeniable links, like Ronald Ragan
to be both a "person" and of a "political" type to be clearly defined. 

If I could continue this project, I would go a lot deeper into the tone and implications of the text. The use
of imperative, for instance, often has a negative overtone. The speaker is instructing the reader, but often in
an ironic way, that is contemptuous. Indeed, there is a kind of bitterness and contempt that is omnipresent
throughout the text and would be a really interesting thing to look into. 

Note- I would've liked to put the dates on the poems
