    <!--Note: I was quite surprised by the structure of this poem- it looks like it would
    be made of several stanzas but instead, the website shows the poem to be made of only two
    parts. Further research revealed that poeple had encoded it different ways but this is primary way.-->
    <stanza no="1">
        <!--Decidede to put Khaki as pop reference as that is what is associated with military
        clothing in popular culture. Khaki is not a neutral colour: military connotations.-->
        <line no="1"><direct-address type="imperative">Give</direct-address> him scars and <reference type="pop">khaki</reference> to wear</line>
        <line no="2"><direct-address type="imperative">Remove</direct-address> his balls, he’ll go anywhere</line>
        <line no="3">He doesn’t speak, he doesn’t dare</line>
        <line no ="4">Death sneaks, he isn’t scared</line>
        <line no="5">Minus balls, he doesn’t care</line>
        <!--Ambiguous use of Jacks, probably referring to the game Jacks, that readers 
        might know from popular games in childhood, drawing them in. + Lexical field of games.-->
        <!--"Action man" reference to doll in pop culture, Action Man. Chose to keep title separate from
        Rest of text, as independant entity, so not commenting on the reference made there too.-->
        <line no="6"><reference type="toy">Jacks</reference> beware, <reference type="toy">action man</reference>.</line>
        <!--Play on Lancashire town name "Accrington" for onomatopea gun sounds -->
        <line no="7">He can ack-ack <reference type="place">Ackrington</reference>, bomb <reference type="place">Berlin</reference></line>
        <line no="8">Reduce <direct-address type="your">your</direct-address> car to a heap of tin</line>
        <line no="9">Wage war, what’s more – win</line>
        <line no="10">Punctured skin means nothing to him</line>
        <line no="11">The human grenade minus pin</line>
        <line no="12">That’s him, <reference type="toy">action man</reference></line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza no="2">
        <line no="3">A chin with a thin <person type="pop">Kirk Douglas</person> cleft</line>
        <!--Ambiguous use of bleeding but main overtone of "bleeding" as colloquial swear word,
        particularly as sounds shouted, emphasised by "don't shout" in next line -->
        <line no="4">Squad by the <colloquial type="swear">bleeding</colloquial> left</line>
        <line no="5"><direct-address type="imperative">Don’t</direct-address> shout he’s deaf</line>
        <line no="6"><colloquial type="saying">Head over heels</colloquial> in love with death</line>
        <line no="7"><direct-address type="imperative">Beware</direct-address> of the wrath of the man bereft</line>
        <!--Consider marriage in this context as pop reference due to popular role of action man in 
        child's games:like his contemporary Ken, Action Man's role in children's games is often
        the male counterpart to Barbie etc, so is invariably a love interest, often attached to marriage.-->
        <line no="8">No <reference type="pop">marriage plans</reference> for <reference type="toy">action man</reference></line>
