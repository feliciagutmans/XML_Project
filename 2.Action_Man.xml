    <!--Note: I was quite surprised by the structure of this poem- it looks like it would
    be made of several stanzas but instead, the website shows the poem to be made of only two
    parts. Further research revealed that poeple had encoded it different ways but this is primary way.-->

        clothing in popular culture. Khaki is not a neutral colour: military connotations.-->

        might know from popular games in childhood.Lexical field of games-->
        <!--"Action man" reference to doll in pop culture, Action Man. Chose to keep title separate from
        Rest of text, as independant entity, so not commenting on the reference made there too.-->
